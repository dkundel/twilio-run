- [`plugin-serverless`](https://github.com/twilio-labs/plugin-serverless) - Wrapper code needed to interact between the [`twilio-run` CLI](https://github.com/twilio-labs/twilio-run) and the [Twilio CLI](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-cli)
- [`twilio-run`](https://github.com/twilio-labs/twilio-run) - The actual CLI code and the code necessary to do local development
- [`serverless-api`](https://github.com/twilio-labs/serverless-api) - Module used to interact with the Twilio Serverless API (handles the actual deployment)
- [`create-twilio-function`](https://github.com/twilio-labs/create-twilio-function) - Code run when `twilio serverless:init` is called
- [`serverless-runtime-types`](https://github.com/twilio-labs/serverless-runtime-types) - TypeScript definitions to describe the runtime environment of Twilio Serverless

## For Maintainers: Releasing

The project uses `standard-version` to bump and git tag the version as well as update the `CHANGELOG.md`. Here are the steps you need to run to release a new version:


### Pre-release version (from `next` branch):

For example to release a new pre-release version containing `beta` and releasing it as `next`:

```bash
npm release -- --prerelease beta
git push origin next --follow-tags 
npm publish --tag next
```

### Normal release (from `master` branch):

For a normal release `standard-version` will detect the version increment automatically. Run:

```bash
npm release
git push origin master --follow-tags
npm publish
```

To ship a specific version instead (like a forced minor bump) you can run:

```bash
npm release -- --release-as minor
git push origin master --follow-tags
npm publish
```
